EMG Repetition Analysis – Methods Documentation
-----------------------------------------------

Overview:
This tool automates the segmentation and feature extraction of surface electromyography (sEMG) signals collected with Delsys Trigno™ wireless sensors. It is designed for reproducible and efficient analysis across multiple sessions and subjects in research settings.

Signal Input:
- Input: CSV files exported from EMG collection software
- Sampling Rate: 1925.926 Hz (Trigno system)
- Channels: 1–3 EMG channels per recording

Preprocessing:
1. Header Detection:
   - Automatically locates the row containing actual channel headers by detecting multiple "X[s]" and "EMG" columns.

2. Channel Selection:
   - User is prompted to select EMG channels from the parsed headers.

3. Signal Normalization:
   - EMG signal is normalized by dividing by the maximum absolute amplitude in that session for each channel.
   - This standardization enables inter-subject and inter-channel comparisons.

Envelope Smoothing:
- An envelope is created using a 200-sample moving average of the absolute EMG signal.
- This reduces high-frequency noise while preserving the overall contraction shape.

Thresholding:
- The envelope is used to estimate the baseline activity level using robust statistics:
  - Median of the envelope
  - Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)
- The detection threshold is calculated as:
  
      threshold = median + 6 × MAD

- This method provides stability in the presence of noise and outliers.

Segmentation:
- Candidate repetitions are identified when the envelope crosses above the threshold.
- To eliminate noise bursts, segments must have a minimum duration of 0.3 seconds (≈577 samples).
- If more segments are detected than expected, the top-N based on envelope amplitude are retained.

Feature Extraction:
For each valid repetition:
- **Start and End Time (s)**
- **Duration (s)**
- **Root Mean Square (RMS)** of normalized EMG
- **Mean Frequency (MF)** via FFT-based power spectrum estimation

Visualization:
- Each EMG channel is plotted with repetition regions highlighted.
- Plots are saved as PNG files alongside the results.

Output Files:
- CSV file containing all repetition-level features with one row per repetition
- JSON file logging metadata per channel (e.g., threshold values, normalization info)
- PNG images per channel for visual inspection of segmentation
